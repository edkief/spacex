A long-running agent loop that drives [opencode](https://opencode.ai) through its HTTP API.

Ralph picks the next unfinished task from a project's `.agent/tasks.json`, runs one agent turn
against it, verifies what actually changed in the repository, and repeats until the backlog is
done, the agent needs a human, or progress stops.

It is built for unattended runs against self-hosted models: no TTY, no sandbox, structured
logs, and watchdogs for the ways an agent turn dies quietly.

## Install

```bash
git clone <this repo> ~/Dev/ralph
cd ~/Dev/ralph
npm install
npm run build
npm link          # optional, puts `ralph` on your PATH
```

## Usage

Run it from the project you want worked on:

```bash
ralph                       # run the loop in the current directory
ralph once                  # a single iteration
ralph doctor                # check the environment, run nothing
ralph config                # print the resolved configuration

ralph -C /path/to/project -n 20 -m ollama/qwen3-coder
```

Without `npm link`, substitute `node ~/Dev/ralph/dist/cli.js`.

Start with `ralph doctor`. It reports every check it makes and runs no model, so it costs
nothing to get wrong.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Every task passes |
| 1 | Iteration budget exhausted with work outstanding |
| 2 | Agent raised `BLOCKED` |
| 3 | Agent raised `DECIDE` |
| 4 | Bad configuration or failed preflight |
| 5 | Model provider or opencode server unusable |
| 6 | Stalled: iterations stopped changing anything |
| 130 | Interrupted |

## What a project must provide

Ralph expects this layout in the project it runs against. `templates/` holds starting points.

```
.agent/
  PROMPT.md        # required — the instructions sent each iteration
  tasks.json       # required — the backlog; a bare array of tasks
  tasks/           # optional — per-task specs referenced by specFilePath
  prd/PRD.md       # optional
  STEERING.md      # optional — work to do before feature tasks
  logs/LOG.md      # optional — the agent's own running log
  history/         # written by ralph
ralph.config.json  # optional
```

A task needs only an `id` and a `passes` flag; `title` and `specFilePath` are used when
present. A `{ "tasks": [...] }` wrapper is accepted in place of a bare array.

The agent signals back with promise tags in its replies:

| Tag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `<promise>TASK-7:DONE</promise>` | Claims a task; checked against the repository |
| `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` | Backlog finished |
| `<promise>BLOCKED:reason</promise>` | Stops the run, exit 2 |
| `<promise>DECIDE:question</promise>` | Stops the run, exit 3 |

## Configuration

Resolution order is defaults < `ralph.config.json` < `RALPH_*` environment < CLI flags.
See `templates/ralph.config.json` for a complete file.

```jsonc
{
  "model": "ollama/qwen3-coder",   // provider/model, as opencode names it
  "maxIterations": 20,
  "pinTask": true,                 // name the task in the prompt instead of letting the model choose
  "timeouts": {
    "iterationMs": 2700000,        // hard ceiling for one turn
    "inactivityMs": 300000         // no events for this long means the agent is wedged
  },
  "retries": {
    "providerRetriesPerIteration": 3,
    "iterationRetries": 1,
    "backoffMs": 15000
  },
  "stall": { "maxUnproductiveIterations": 3 },
  "permissions": {
    "fallback": "allow",           // unattended runs need to proceed without a human
    "deny": ["git push", "git remote"]
  },
  "server": { "url": "http://opencode:4096" }  // attach instead of spawning
}
```

The env overrides worth setting from a k8s manifest: `RALPH_MODEL`, `RALPH_MAX_ITERATIONS`,
`RALPH_SERVER_URL`, `RALPH_SERVER_PASSWORD`, `RALPH_ITERATION_TIMEOUT_MS`,
`RALPH_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_MS`, `RALPH_LOG_FORMAT=json`.

## How it works

Ralph spawns `opencode serve` (or attaches to one with `server.url`), then per iteration:

1. Reads `.agent/tasks.json` and picks the first task with `passes: false`.
2. Builds the prompt from `.agent/PROMPT.md`, naming that task.
3. Opens a session, subscribes to `/api/event`, and sends the prompt.
4. Consumes the SSE stream, answering permission requests from policy.
5. Snapshots git and the task list before and after, and compares.

Pinning the task matters for smaller self-hosted models: "work on TASK-7" is a far more
reliable instruction than "pick the highest-priority task with `passes: false`", which asks
the model to re-derive selection logic the loop already knows. Set `pinTask: false` to hand
that choice back to the agent.

When Ralph spawns the server it captures the generated password from the server's own stdout
banner, so credentials are never scraped from `opencode pair`.

### Why the repository is the source of truth

The agent's `<promise>TASK-7:DONE</promise>` is a claim, not evidence. An iteration counts as
progress only when something actually changed: a commit landed, a `passes` flag flipped, or
files were modified. A run whose iterations stop changing anything ends as `stalled` rather
than quietly burning the whole budget.

### Failure modes it watches for

| Watchdog | What it catches |
| --- | --- |
| `retry-storm` | Provider unreachable or rate limited. opencode retries with backoff, emitting no text and no error — the loop would otherwise hang indefinitely. |
| `inactivity` | Agent produced no events at all for `inactivityMs`. |
| `iteration-timeout` | Turn exceeded its hard budget. |

All three interrupt the session server-side rather than killing a process, so opencode can
clean up. Provider failures and timeouts retry the whole turn (`retries.iterationRetries`);
they say nothing about the task itself.

Permission requests are answered from policy, never left waiting for a human. Deny rules beat
allow rules, so a broad allow list cannot re-enable something explicitly forbidden.

## Run artefacts

Each run writes to the project's `.agent/history/<runId>/`:

- `iteration-NNN.events.jsonl` — every event received, for debugging
- `iterations.jsonl` — one record per iteration with outcome, usage and repository delta
- `run.json` — the run summary

## Notes on the opencode API

- Health is probed with `/api/location`. `/api/status` exists only on the background service,
  not on a standalone `opencode serve`.
- Skills register asynchronously after startup: an immediate query returns an empty list.
  Preflight waits for the count to settle so the first iteration is not silently skill-less.
- Preflight asserts the operationIds the loop calls still exist in the server's live
  `/openapi.json`, so a version mismatch fails loudly instead of at runtime.
- A tool's name arrives on `session.tool.input.started` while its input arrives on
  `session.tool.called`; they are correlated by call id.

The published `@opencode-ai/sdk` lags the v2 API, so this package deliberately does not depend
on it.

## Development

```bash
npm test          # unit + integration tests against a fake opencode server
npm run typecheck
```

`test/helpers/fake-server.ts` is a stand-in for opencode's HTTP API that makes the failure
paths — retry storms, timeouts, permission policy, stalls — deterministic and fast.

`test/fixtures/session-events.jsonl` is a real captured session, scrubbed of identifying
paths. The event parser is tested against it so schema drift in opencode shows up as a test
failure rather than a silent no-op at runtime.
